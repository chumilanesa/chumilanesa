### ✨ Bienvenidos!

My name is Gloria "Chumi" Gonzalez and I’m a UI Developer turned Product Manager. I was raised in Paraguay and am currently based in NYC. My work experiences cover a wide array of skills including marketing, graphic/UX design, frontend development, and product management. 

I’m passionate about bringing ideas to life, bridging the gap between design and engineering in tech, women/immigrant rights, & creating positive experiences for people.
